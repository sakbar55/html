<h1> Web Revolution</h1>

<h2>My Take</h2>
<p>
It's obvious that web design has evolved greatly and still continues to.
The internet is no longer a world of flat dimension and basic imaging. Faulty GIF's and text-based
pages are prehistoric!
</p>
<p>
It's amazing how we've come from basic grid systems to flash players to web applications that
open up in our mobile devices. Thanks to the seperation between content and design (CSS),
web designers were now able to design pages with more creative freedom and smoother efficiency.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to new units, flexbox, and web components, the web can now be designed with less
frustrating coding processes and easier ways to build and re-use the building blocks
that go into building web designs. We've come a long way and the web still continues to
become aesthetically and functionally advanced.
